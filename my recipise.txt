THIS IS A LEMON CAKE RECIPE

Ingridents:
  1/2 cup unsalted butter
  2 cup all purpose flour
  2 lemon(cut in thin slices)
  coarse salt
  1/4 cup lemon juice
  2 teaspoon baking powder
  1/2 teaspoon baking soda
  1 cup granulated sugar 
  2 eggs
  1/2 cup buttermilk
  1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions:
  Step 1
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan (2 inches deep). In a medium saucepan, cover lemon slices with 3 cups water. Add pinch of salt, cover, and bring to a boil over high. Boil lemons, partially covered, until very tender, 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and transfer to a food processor, along with lemon juice; process until smooth. Set aside.

  Step 2
    In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat butter on medium, 2 minutes. Gradually add granulated sugar and continue to beat until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down bowl as needed. Add eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition.
  
  Step 3
    With mixer on low, gradually add flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with 2 additions buttermilk. Beat in vanilla, then fold in lemon mixture.

  Step 4
    Transfer batter to pan and bake until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted in center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack, 20 minutes. Remove cake from pan and let cool completely on rack.
